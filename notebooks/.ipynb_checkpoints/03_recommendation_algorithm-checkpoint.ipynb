    "**Current Situation:**\n",
    "- Streamly uses random title selection for recommendations\n",
    "- Users report poor satisfaction with suggestions\n",
    "- No consideration for user preferences or content appropriateness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives (implemented in this notebook and backend):**\n",
    "The recommendation algorithm implemented here:\n",
    "- Respects content appropriateness for kids profiles (filters to kids content when requested)\n",
    "- Considers user preferences (language, genres)\n",
    "- Accounts for user demographics (age band) where available\n",
    "- Produces a preference-based ranking (by preference match score)\n",
    "- Is computationally efficient and easily explainable\n",
    "- Works without historical viewing data (cold start scenario)"

    "## Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Kids Content Filtering\n",
    "**Decision:** Use binary `kids_profile` flag to filter content when the profile indicates a kids profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Age-appropriate content is critical for user safety and satisfaction.\n",
    "- If `kids_profile == 1` we limit recommendations to content flagged as kids content.\n",
    "- For non-kids profiles we do not exclude titles (implementation intentionally keeps all titles available).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Language Preference Matching\n",
    "**Decision:** Exact match on `preferred_language`, with fallback to NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Users prefer content in languages they understand.\n",
    "- Include NULL values (universal/multilingual content) so language-missing titles are still considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Genre/Category Preference Scoring\n",
    "**Decision:** Binary score (1 or 0) based on category match.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- User preferences are stored as comma-separated genres.\n",
    "- Score = 1 if title category matches any preference; otherwise 0.\n",
    "- This keeps the algorithm simple and explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Efficiency Considerations\n",
    "**Decision:** Use straightforward, vectorized operations and keep logic simple to match the production backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:**\n",
    "- Implementation reads profile and catalog from SQLite and performs in-memory filtering and vectorized scoring in pandas.\n",
    "- This keeps latency low and behavior predictable."
